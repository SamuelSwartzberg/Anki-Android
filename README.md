Anki for Android - Redesign
-------
Anki for Android is a semi-official port of the open source [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/index.html) spaced repetition flashcard system. This redesign follows the updated Material Design guidelines (https://material.io/design/). It makes the app more user-friendly by allowing the flashcards to become the focus of the app.
